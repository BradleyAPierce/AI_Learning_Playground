            <strong>Heard of OpenAI, Google Gemini, ChatGPT, or Claude?</strong>
            <br>This page explains what these “Providers” actually do, and makes it easy to talk about them—even if you have no tech background.

        <!-- What is an MCP? -->
        <section class="mb-5">
          <h2 class="text-primary fs-3 mb-2">🌐 What Is a "Model Completion Provider" (MCP)?</h2>
          <p>
            When people talk about using “AI” or “LLMs” (Large Language Models), they usually don’t talk directly to the model itself. Instead, they connect through a <b>provider</b>—a company, website, or platform that gives them access to those AIs.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>The LLM</b> is the brain that can read, write, explain, and answer questions.</li>
            <li><b>The MCP</b> is like the company running a “library” or “service desk” where you get to interact with that brain.</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="rounded bg-white border p-3 mcp-tip mb-2">
            <b>Analogy:</b> Think of an LLM as a blockbuster movie, and the MCP is like Netflix or Amazon Prime—the place you go to actually watch it!

        <!-- Why Use MCPs? -->
        <section class="mb-5">
          <h2 class="text-primary fs-4 mb-2">🤝 Why Do We Use MCPs?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><b>LLMs are huge and complicated.</b> They need powerful computers and constant care—far too complex for most people or businesses to run themselves.</li>
            <li><b>MCPs "host" these models</b> and make them easy to use, through websites, chatbots, or business apps.</li>
            <li><b>MCPs handle:</b> updates, security, privacy, and even billing—so you just focus on asking questions or getting work done.</li>
          </ul>
