              üß† What Is a Large Language Model (LLM)?
            </h2>
            <p>
              An <b>LLM</b>, or <b>Large Language Model</b>, is a type of AI
              that can read, write, summarize, translate, and answer
              questions‚Äîusing natural, human-sounding language.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                LLMs are trained by analyzing huge amounts of text from the
                internet, books, articles, and more.
              </li>
              <li>
                They are the "brains" behind today's AI assistants (like
                ChatGPT), smart chatbots, and many business automations.
              </li>
              <li>
                The "large" part means they're trained with billions of words
                and have learned millions (or billions!) of ways people use
                language.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Understanding what LLMs are‚Äîand what they're not‚Äîmakes you better
              prepared to:
            </p>

                Talk knowledgeably with technical teams, vendors, or clients

              üîç How Do LLMs Actually Work?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Imagine teaching a super-powered text predictor that‚Äôs read almost
              every book, article, and website‚Äîbut never truly ‚Äúunderstands‚Äù
              like a person.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <b>Train on huge amounts of text.</b><br />
                The AI reads and learns language patterns‚Äîsentence by sentence,
                word by word.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Break down language into ‚Äútokens.‚Äù</b><br />
                Tokens are like word-pieces or building blocks the AI uses to
                make sense of what you type.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Predict what comes next.</b><br />
                When you ask a question, the AI predicts the most likely next
                words in response‚Äîone step at a time, at lightning speed!
              </li>
            </ol>

                <b>Massive Training:</b> AI researchers use powerful computers

                months.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Pretraining:</b> The AI first learns general language
                skills‚Äîlike grammar, facts, and common sense.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Fine-tuning:</b> Sometimes, the AI is retrained for special
                skills, like legal or medical help, company-specific chatbots,
                or customer service.
